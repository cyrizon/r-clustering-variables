acp_voitures.csv
- Description: Small automobile dataset (approximately 6 variables) often used for demonstration of PCA and variable clustering.
- Typical interpretation: ~3 clusters: (1) engine displacement; (2) performance (top speed, power); (3) size/packaging (width, length, weight).

jobrate.csv
- Description: Job/employee rating dataset (~12 explanatory variables plus an illustrative variable `Overall_Rating`).
- Typical interpretation: ~4 clusters in the original demo examples.

protein_dataset.csv
- Description: Protein measurements dataset (about 9 variables). The appropriate number of clusters is ambiguous: 2, 3 or 4 clusters can all be defensible depending on interpretation.

vote_catvarclus.csv
- Description: Categorical variables only — typically 6 explanatory categorical variables and 1 illustrative variable (`affiliation`).
- Typical interpretation: ~3 clusters (e.g., similar "neither" responses grouped, yes/no splits on other items).

AUTOS2005subset.txt
- Description: Mixed data (numerical + categorical). No definitive clustering suggested by the original notes; used as an example of mixed-type data.

tea_data.csv
- Description: Tea consumption and preferences dataset with 300 observations and 18 categorical variables describing consumption patterns, timing (breakfast, tea.time, evening, lunch, dinner, always), places (home, work, tearoom, friends, resto, pub), tea type (black, Earl Grey, green), preparation (alone, milk, lemon, sugar), packaging (tea bag, unpackaged), purchase location (chain store, tea shop), and price category.
- Typical interpretation: Excellent dataset for demonstrating ACM (Multiple Correspondence Analysis) clustering of categorical variables. Expected clusters might group by: (1) traditional tea drinkers (black tea, milk, sugar); (2) Earl Grey enthusiasts; (3) health-conscious consumers (green tea, no sugar); (4) social/occasional drinkers.
- Use case: Ideal for exploring associations between tea preferences, consumption patterns, timing, and purchase behavior. All 18 variables are factors.
