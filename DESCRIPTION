Description: 
  This package provides several algorithms for variable clustering 
  (including hierarchical, relocation-based, and qualitative-variable methods)
  implemented with R6 object-oriented classes. 
  It also includes interpretation tools (plots, summaries, membership tables)
  and an integrated Shiny application for interactive exploration of results.
